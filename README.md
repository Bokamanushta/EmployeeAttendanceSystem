# Employee Attendance System

## Problems

You may believe or not, there are still many companies do not automate their attendance system while some of them use old punch card to track employee attendance. Hence they face problems like 

* Data Entry Error
* Slow data compilation
* Loss of the Card
* Payroll Errors
* Time Theft

## Solutions

Well, we propose an RFID based attendance system, where employee will just scan his RFID card to make attendance. Now, you may think it is very simple, itâ€™s a lie, we can actually do a lots of complex things with that. 

* Automated Report Generation
* Automated Payroll System
* Accurate Data Processing
